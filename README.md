# epoxy_tool_mat
This repository contains a 3D model for 3D printing. The intention of the print it to serve as negative for a silicone mat. This mat can then be used to convert remains of epoxy into tools.

If you are living in the US, you can buy something similar as ['Utility Mat'](https://www.keithdecent.com/shop/Preorder-The-Utility-Mat-SMALL-15-x-12-p530054317) from Artist Keith Decent.

You can find a long description of my process building this tool mat on my blog:
